On Heroku:

- [Process Types and the Procfile:](https://goo.gl/hHiCj3) these are the contracts
  between your app and heroku. You tell them *what it is* the and they will do
  everything needed to run it, now and in the future.

- [Heroku Add-ons:](https://goo.gl/XIa7dB) are services that integrate with Heroku
  quite well. They may be databases, file storage, monitoring, email, sms and more.

- [Scheduled Jobs and Custom Clock Processes:](https://goo.gl/66M8Jg) is a way
  to programatically run processes at specific times or intervals.
