# Useful tools

This week is going to be concentrated on building useful tools for the GSG
community.

Here are some ideas:

### Order breakfast/lunch
We always get food late and sometimes have no choice. The super app of Hani didn't
really work, let's help him.
Build a website where everyday we can oder breakfast and lunch. When visiting it
the user should see a form with a time deadline. Each order is saved on a Google
Sheet and at a specific time e.g. 10:30am the order will be sent to Hani on the
phone as an SMS.

### Facebook messaging reminder
In GSG we host many events and ask people to register via Google Forms. However
then we spend a lot of time reaching them out and making sure they are coming.
Hani does that via Facebook Messenger manually which is quite inefficient (that's
why he is late with our food). Let's build an app and [bot](https://goo.gl/lseQ9E),
which goes through the Google Sheet with the names and sends a Facebook Messenger
reminder asking them to confirm.

### Coding bootcamp applications
When people put the application we should track them down on CodeWars and update
their scores everyday. If they do not work for 2 days in a row we should send them
a message or email, pushing them to keep working.
