# Useful tools

This week is going to be concentrated on building useful tools for the GSG
community.

Here are some ideas:

### Order breakfast/lunch for the cohort


### Coding For Everyone Facebook messaging system


### GSG applications with tracking

When people put the application we should track them down on CodeWars and update
their scores everyday. If they do not work for 2 days in a row we should send them
a message or email.
