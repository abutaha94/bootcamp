## Autocomplete website/widget

#### Description
- A website that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of
  suggestions, as they type.
- The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values (i.e. a
  dictionary file), leveraging searching and filtering.
- A large data file is required to search through - consider the best data
  structure for this (e.g. `.txt` or `.json`).
- Consider how implementation affects user experience and web performance (e.g.
  time to load and search through the data file).

#### Task
Your task is to build a site which will update as you type (an autocompleter),
as per the description above.

#### Goals
1. We expect __back-end testing using tape__ (test as many components as you can)
   and basic __front-end testing__.

2. Try to host your project on __heroku__, [see resource](https://goo.gl/jpaG78).

3. Use __module.exports__ and __require__ to break a single large server file
   into smaller modules. 

4. Consider what would be a good __server file structure__ based on what we have
   discussed over the week.

#### Notes
Follow best practices, use GitHub issues to track work, pull requests and code
review to make sure everything is correct and trackable.

Write a README explaining what the project is and user stories. Try to go in
detail with the user stories and [acceptance criteria](https://goo.gl/CTh5VA).
