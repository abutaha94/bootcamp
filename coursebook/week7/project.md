## Project

Blog site with CMS (content management system).

### Task
- This week you'll build a blog with a CMS (content management system) using the
  Hapi.js framework!
- You'll use a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data.
- You'll use the retrieved data to populate a handlebars template for _server-side_
  rendering to be displayed on the front-end.

### Goals

The primary aim of this project is to get comfortable with setting up a Hapi
server and to discover the awesomeness of handlebars.js! Spend time considering
how to format your helper functions, layouts, partials and views.

What's also important:

- Use the hapi-auth-cookie module for session management with
  [cookies](https://github.com/SavageWilliam/hapi-auth-cookie-ws)
- Use the `server.inject` method to test your server
- Aim for as high code coverage as possible, on front-end and back-end
- Try to use basic ES6 syntax
