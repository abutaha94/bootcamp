# Research afternoon

## Validation
1. Research what data validation is, and how it can be implemented in hapi.
2. Create a basic hapi project, in which you use `Joi` to validate that the
   user-provided e-mail and password are of the correct format.

## Authentication
1. Research what authentication and password encryption are, and how they can be
   implemented in hapi.
2. Create a basic hapi project, in which you use `Bcrypt` to hash stored passwords,
   and use `hapi-auth-basic` to authenticate a user based on the provided password.

## Cookies and caching
1. Research what cookies are, and why they can be useful to remember stateful
   information.
2. Research what caching is, and why is it important for your application's
   performance.

## Templating with helper functions
1. Research what helper functions are, and how they can be implemented in Handlebars.
2. Create a basic hapi project with Handlebars templating, in which you use at
   least one in-built Handlebars helper function and one custom helper function.
