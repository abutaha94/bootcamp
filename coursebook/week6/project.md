# Facebook

This week project is to build a small, but functional, version of Facebook. Among
the functionalities there should be a login page with authentication, a profile
page, ability to post a status and the main feed.

The main goal as usual is learning, so focus on the backend and database side. The
code will grow so make sure to write tests from the beginning and implement continuos
integration and deployment.
