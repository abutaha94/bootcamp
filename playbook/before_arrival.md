# Before you arrive

### Get a laptop

If you do not yet have a laptop, get one. If you want something inexpensive, a
ChromeBook with at least 4GB of RAM is a good option.

### Set up a dev environment

Get your computer set up for software development. 

If you have a Mac, you are more-or-less ready to go. 

If you have a ChromeBook, you will want to install Linux, using [crouton](https://git.io/crouton). If you want help, then just
[try google](https://goo.gl/3WYu44). There are several decent tutorials out there.

If you have a Windows PC, you may want to consider also installing Linux on it.
It can be a bit of a pain, but is probably preferable (at least, in our experience)
to trying to work with Windows. Good luck.

### Install a text editor

We suggest [Atom](https://atom.io/). Atom is free and maintained by the 
open-source community.

### Get familiar with the command line

We are going to be spending a lot of time working on the command line.
If you don't know anything about the command line, then try Zed Shaw's
[CLI Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/).

### Learn the basics of HTTP

Here's a [pretty good introduction](https://goo.gl/FuiuVV).

### Git

Work through our [Introduction to Git and Version Control](https://goo.gl/zxT727).

### READMEs and markdown

This document is a README. We are going to use them a lot on this course.

Read [Readme Driven Development](https://goo.gl/DCWsCC) and then, if you do not
already know markdown, complete [this short tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/).
