## Free Code Camp

[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) is a fantastic resource for learning to code. If you are just beginning to get to grips with programming, this study group is a great place to start.

The emphasis this evening will be on making our first steps with Free Code Camp. Before you come, we recommend that you get started on some of their exercises and make as much progress as you can before the meetup.

This is a peer-led session. Come prepared to ask questions and to help others.
